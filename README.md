ðŸ˜Š Welcome to my profile. ðŸ˜Š

Iâ€™m a full stack developer with over 9 years of full time working experience.
My working history starts in 2012 since that time I worked in many different roles and teams from startups to lead dev position in a big enterprise company.
During that time I was always thirsty to learn and try new things, new tech stacks and understand different approaches of development.

My main tech stacks are:
- âœ… React ...
- âœ… React Native ...
- âœ… Laravel ...
- âœ… Wordpress (Theme customize, Plugin dev, Theme and plugin installation) ...
- âœ… Shopify (Theme customize, Shopify plugin development)

Currently I'm working as an individual dev,
I'm self-disciplined and self-managed productivity hacker who loves to make new things people want. I aspire to build long-term relationships with open-minded and goal-oriented clients.

Feel free to contact me.
Best Regards
Lee
